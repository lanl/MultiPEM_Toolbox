A symbolic link to the application independent code needed for
verification tests should be placed in this directory as follows:

% ln -s ../Code/ Code

The file "tests.r" will generate output from two global
verifiction tests:
1) "Covariance": Verify Jacobian of transformation used for
   general observational error covariance structure
2) "FME_test": Verify performance of adaptive Markov chain
   Monte Carlo algorithm in R package FME by comparing
   posterior samples to analytical solutions
