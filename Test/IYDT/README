Symbolic links to IYDT-specific code needed for verification
testing should be placed in this directory as follows:

% ln -s ../../Applications/Code/IYDT/ Code
% ln -s ../../Applications/Test/IYDT/ Test

The file "tests.r" in each phenomenology directory will
generate output from the complete set of verification tests.
