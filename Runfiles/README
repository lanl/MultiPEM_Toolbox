This directory will contain subdirectories for each application.
Each analysis for a given application will be designated by
individual subdirectories within the associated application
directory. Each analysis directory will contain a "runMPEM.r"
file that provides the R code that is to be run for that analysis.

A symbolic link to the application independent code needed for
each analysis should be placed in this directory as follows:

% ln -s ../Code/ Code

The Code/ directory contains functions utilized across
applications, such as the log-likelihood, log-prior, and log-
posterior distributions and their associated gradients.

Analyses can be run by:
1) cutting and pasting from "runMPEM.r" into an interactive R
   session
2) starting an R session and running, e.g.

> source("runMPEM.r")

3) running in batch mode from the command line, e.g.

% R CMD BATCH runMPEM.r runMPEM.out &

or

% nohup R CMD BATCH runMPEM.r runMPEM.out & disown

for longer jobs when the user must log off the machine.

NOTE: #2 and #3 assume Mac/Linux OS; if running in Windows
one can presumably find instructions online.
