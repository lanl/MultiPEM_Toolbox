Sub-analysis Directories:

I-EIV - no variance component model with errors-in-variables
        yields for calibration data
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob - I-EIV with W/HOB inference for SUGAR
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi - I-EIV-SUGAR-hob except informative prior
                     distribution for W and HOB
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0 - two-stage rapid assessment of W/HOB
                    inference for "new event" SUGAR,
                    with errors-in-variables yields
                    for calibration data
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi-0 - I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0 except informative prior
                       distribution for W and HOB

If a more informed starting value for new event
log-likelihood optimization is desired:
1) Create an "Opt" directory
2) After calibration sub-analysis (here, I-EIV) completes,
   copy MLE results into this "Opt" directory
   prior to running I-EIV-SUGAR-* sub-analyses:
	cp I-EIV/opt.RData Opt/opt_eiv.RData

*** MULTI-STAGE RAPID ASSESSMENT ***

For rapid assessments in which the calibration inference
is intended for use in multiple new event inferences:
1) Go to the directory containing the baseline case:

% cd I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0

2) Run the runMPEM.r file to calibrate the model parameters

3) Copy the .RData file into the additional case directories
   upon completion of this run, for example:

% cp .RData ../I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi-0/.

4) For each case, run the runMPEM_0.r file to characterize the
   new event parameters

If only one rapid assessment is to be conducted, first run the
runMPEM.r file and once the job completes, run the runMPEM_0.r
file.
