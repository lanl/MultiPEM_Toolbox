Sub-analysis Directories:

I - level 1 variance components responses 1 and 2
I-SUGAR-hob - level 1 variance components responses 1 and 2;
              W/HOB inference for "new event" SUGAR
I-SUGAR-hob-pi - I-SUGAR-hob except informative prior
                 distribution for W and HOB
I-SUGAR-hob-0 - two-stage rapid assessment of W/HOB
                inference for "new event" SUGAR
I-SUGAR-hob-pi-0 - I-SUGAR-hob-0 except informative prior
                   distribution for W and HOB

If a more informed starting value for new event
log-likelihood optimization is desired:
1) Create an "Opt" directory
2) After calibration sub-analysis (here, I) completes, copy
   MLE results into this "Opt" directory
   prior to running I-SUGAR-* sub-analyses:
	cp I/opt.RData Opt/opt.RData

*** MULTI-STAGE RAPID ASSESSMENT ***

For rapid assessments in which the calibration inference
is intended for use in multiple new event inferences:
1) Go to the directory containing the baseline case:

% cd I-SUGAR-hob-0

2) Run the runMPEM.r file to calibrate the model parameters

3) Copy the .RData file into the additional case directories
   upon completion of this run, for example:

% cp .RData ../I-SUGAR-hob-pi-0/.

4) For each case, run the runMPEM_0.r file to characterize the
   new event parameters

If only one rapid assessment is to be conducted, first run the
runMPEM.r file and once the job completes, run the runMPEM_0.r
file.
