A symbolic link to IYDT phenomenology-specific code needed for
these analyses should be placed in this directory as follows:

% ln -s ../../../Applications/Code/IYDT-gsrp/Phenomenology/ Code

                    W/HOB inference for "new event"

*** MULTI-STAGE RAPID ASSESSMENT ***

For rapid assessments in which the calibration inference
is intended for use in multiple new event inferences:
1) Go to the directory containing the baseline case:

% cd I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0

2) Run the runMPEM.r file to calibrate the model parameters

3) Copy the .RData file into the additional case directories
   upon completion of this run, for example:

% cp .RData ../<additional case directory>/.

4) For each case, run the runMPEM_0.r file to characterize the
   new event parameters

If only one rapid assessment is to be conducted, first run the
runMPEM.r file and once the job completes, run the runMPEM_0.r
file.
