A symbolic link to IYDT phenomenology-specific code needed for
these analyses should be placed in this directory as follows:

% ln -s ../../../Applications/Code/IYDT-gsrp/Phenomenology/ Code

Joint analysis with 2 phenomenologies:
  seismic, acoustic

Sub-analysis Directory:

I-SUGAR-hob-0 - two-stage rapid assessment of W/HOB
                inference for "new event" SUGAR

*** MULTI-STAGE RAPID ASSESSMENT ***

For rapid assessments in which the calibration inference
is intended for use in multiple new event inferences:
1) Go to the directory containing the baseline case:

% cd I-SUGAR-hob-0

2) Run the runMPEM.r file to calibrate the model parameters

3) Copy the .RData file into the additional case directories
   upon completion of this run, for example:

% cp .RData ../<additional case directory>/.

4) For each case, run the runMPEM_0.r file to characterize the
   new event parameters

If only one rapid assessment is to be conducted, first run the
runMPEM.r file and once the job completes, run the runMPEM_0.r
file.

If a more informed starting value for MultiPEM log-likelihood
optimization is desired:
1) Create an "Opt" directory
2) Copy MLE results from each optimal single-phenomenology
   analysis into this "Opt" directory
3) Continue with step 1) above

        cp ../Seismic/I-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_1_0.RData
                                                         seismic
        cp ../Acoustic/I-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_2_0.RData       
                                                        acoustic
