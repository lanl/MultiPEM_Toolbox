A symbolic link to IYDT phenomenology-specific code needed for
these analyses should be placed in this directory as follows:

% ln -s ../../../Applications/Code/IYDT-gsrp/Phenomenology/ Code

Joint analysis with 4 phenomenologies:
  seismic, acoustic, optical, crater

Sub-analysis Directories:

I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0 - two-stage rapid assessment of
                    W/HOB inference for "new event"
                    SUGAR, with errors-in-variables
                    yields for benchmark data
I-SUGAR-hob-0     - two-stage rapid assessment of W/HOB

                    fixed yields for benchmark data
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob   - complete assessment of W/HOB inference
                    for "new event" SUGAR, with

                    benchmark data

*** MULTI-STAGE RAPID ASSESSMENT ***

For rapid assessments in which the calibration inference
is intended for use in multiple new event inferences:
1) Go to the directory containing the baseline case:

% cd I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0

2) Run the runMPEM.r file to calibrate the model parameters

3) Copy the .RData file into the additional case directories
   upon completion of this run, for example:

% cp .RData ../<additional case directory>/.

4) For each case, run the runMPEM_0.r file to characterize the
   new event parameters

If only one rapid assessment is to be conducted, first run the
runMPEM.r file and once the job completes, run the runMPEM_0.r
file.

If a more informed starting value for MultiPEM log-likelihood
optimization is desired:
1) Create an "Opt" directory
2) Copy MLE results from each optimal single-phenomenology
   analysis into this "Opt" directory
3) Continue with step 1) above

        cp ../Seismic/I-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_1_0.RData
                                                                seismic
        cp ../Acoustic/I-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_2_0.RData       
                                                                acoustic
        cp ../Optical/I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_3_eiv_0.RData
                                                                optical
        cp ../Optical/I-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_3_0.RData
                                                                optical
        cp ../Crater/I-EIV-SUGAR-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_4_eiv_0.RData 
                                                                crater
        cp ../Crater/I-SUGAR-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_4_0.RData
                                                                crater
