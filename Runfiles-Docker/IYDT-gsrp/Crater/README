Sub-analysis Directories:

I-EIV-SUGAR-0 - two-stage rapid assessment of
                W inference for "new event"
                SUGAR, with errors-in-variables
                yields for benchmark data
I-SUGAR-0     - two-stage rapid assessment of W
                inference for "new event" SUGAR, with
                fixed yields for benchmark data
I-EIV-SUGAR   - complete assessment of W inference for
                "new event" SUGAR, with
                errors-in-variables yields for
                benchmark data
I-SUGAR       - complete assessment of W inference for
                "new event" SUGAR, with fixed yields
                for benchmark data

Running Sub-analyses:

1) Assume the "MultiPEM_Toolbox" directory is placed
   in the user's home directory.

2) Create Dockerfile in each sub-analysis directory.

3) Build an image for each sub-analysis and run the image
   by starting a container. For example, to run the
   sub-analysis in the I-EIV-SUGAR directory, execute the
   following commands:

% cd I-EIV-SUGAR
% docker build -t crater/i-eiv-sugar .
% docker run -it --rm -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT-gsrp/Crater/I-EIV-SUGAR:\
  /I-EIV-SUGAR -d crater/i-eiv-sugar

4) Once the sub-analysis completes, the image may be
   deleted by executing the command:

% docker image rm crater/i-eiv-sugar

*** MULTI-STAGE RAPID ASSESSMENT ***

For rapid assessments in which the calibration inference
is intended for use in multiple new event inferences,
replace steps 3) and 4) above as follows:

3) Build an image for the calibration inference (stage 1)
   and run the image by starting a container. For example,
   to run the calibration inference in the I-EIV-SUGAR-0
   directory, execute the following commands:

% cd I-EIV-SUGAR-0
% docker build -f Dockerfile_cal -t crater/i-eiv-sugar-cal .
% docker run -it --rm -v crater_eiv_cal:/crater_eiv_cal -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT-gsrp/Crater/I-EIV-SUGAR-0:\
  /I-EIV-SUGAR-0 -d crater/i-eiv-sugar-cal

  The docker run command creates the volume crater_eiv_cal,
  which is used to persist the .RData file resulting from
  the stage 1 calibration inference so that it can be
  used in other analyses (obviating the need to run the
  same calibration inference multiple times).

  Upon completion of the stage 1 run, build an image for the
  new event inference (stage 2) and run the image by starting
  a container. For example, to run the new event inference in
  the I-EIV-SUGAR-0 directory, execute the following commands:

% cd I-EIV-SUGAR-0
% docker build -f Dockerfile_0 -t crater/i-eiv-sugar-0 .
% docker run -it --rm -v crater_eiv_cal:/crater_eiv_cal:ro -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT-gsrp/Crater/I-EIV-SUGAR-0:\
  /I-EIV-SUGAR-0 -d crater/i-eiv-sugar-0

  Note that this docker run command binds to the crater_eiv_cal
  volume, in order to access the .RData file from the stage
  1 calibration inference as desired.

4) Once all analyses are complete, the volume and images
   may be deleted by executing the commands:

% docker volume rm crater_eiv_cal
% docker image rm crater/i-eiv-sugar-cal crater/i-eiv-sugar-0
