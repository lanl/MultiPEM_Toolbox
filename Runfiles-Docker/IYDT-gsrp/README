The data supporting the IYDT analyses were provided by Sean Ford
of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and can be found in
the Data/ directory.

The Code/ directory contains functions utilized in the IYDT
analyses, including forward models for each phenomenology
and their associated gradients.

Four phenomenologies are considered: Seismic, Acoustic, Optical, and
Crater. The first three of these were considered by Ford and
colleagues in their work referenced below. Chemical explosions are
used to calibrate seismic and acoustic models, while nuclear
explosions are used to calibrate optical and crater models. The
nuclear event "SUGAR" is considered as the "new event" whose
yield and height-of-burst are to be predicted with uncertainty.

Phenomenology-specific code filenames should be distinct from
application-specific code filenames.

NOTE: The option "iBayes = TRUE" is set by default in each of
the "runMPEM.r" files provided for this application. This
option runs Bayesian analyses in addition to maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE). For faster runs, use only MLE
by setting "iBayes = FALSE"
