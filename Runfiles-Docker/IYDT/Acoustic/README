Sub-analysis Directories:

I - level 1 variance components responses 1 and 2
I-SUGAR-hob - level 1 variance components responses 1 and 2;
              W/HOB inference for "new event" SUGAR
I-SUGAR-hob-pi - I-SUGAR-hob except informative prior
                 distribution for W and HOB
I-SUGAR-hob-0 - two-stage rapid assessment of W/HOB
                inference for "new event" SUGAR
I-SUGAR-hob-pi-0 - I-SUGAR-hob-0 except informative prior
                   distribution for W and HOB

If a more informed starting value for new event
log-likelihood optimization is desired:
1) Create an "Opt" directory
2) After calibration sub-analysis (here, I) completes, copy
   MLE results into this "Opt" directory
   prior to running I-SUGAR-* sub-analyses:
	cp I/opt.RData Opt/opt.RData

Running Sub-analyses:

1) Assume the "MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package" directory is placed
   in the user's home directory.

2) Create Dockerfile in each sub-analysis directory.

3) Build an image for each sub-analysis and run the image
   by starting a container. For example, to run the
   sub-analysis in the I directory, execute the following
   commands:

% cd I
% docker build -t acoustic/i .
% docker run -it --rm -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT/Acoustic/I:/I \
  -d acoustic/i

4) Once the sub-analysis completes, the image may be
   deleted by executing the command:

% docker image rm acoustic/i

*** MULTI-STAGE RAPID ASSESSMENT ***

For rapid assessments in which the calibration inference
is intended for use in multiple new event inferences,
replace steps 3) and 4) above as follows:

3) Build an image for the calibration inference (stage 1)
   and run the image by starting a container. For example,
   to run the calibration inference in the I-SUGAR-hob-0
   directory, execute the following commands:

% cd I-SUGAR-hob-0
% docker build -f Dockerfile_cal -t acoustic/i-sugar-cal .
% docker run -it --rm -v acoustic_cal:/acoustic_cal -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT/Acoustic/I-SUGAR-hob-0:\
  /I-SUGAR-hob-0 -d acoustic/i-sugar-cal

  The docker run command creates the volume acoustic_cal,
  which is used to persist the .RData file resulting from
  the stage 1 calibration inference so that it can be
  used in other analyses (obviating the need to run the
  same calibration inference multiple times).

  Upon completion of the stage 1 run, build an image for the
  new event inference (stage 2) and run the image by starting
  a container. For example, to run the new event inference in
  the I-SUGAR-hob-pi-0 directory, execute the following commands:

% cd I-SUGAR-hob-pi-0
% docker build -f Dockerfile_0 -t acoustic/i-sugar-hob-pi-0 .
% docker run -it --rm -v acoustic_cal:/acoustic_cal:ro -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT/Acoustic/I-SUGAR-hob-pi-0:\
  /I-SUGAR-hob-pi-0 -d acoustic/i-sugar-hob-pi-0

  Note that this docker run command binds to the acoustic_cal
  volume, in order to access the .RData file from the stage
  1 calibration inference as desired.

4) Once all analyses are complete, the volume and images
   may be deleted by executing the commands:

% docker volume rm acoustic_cal
% docker image rm acoustic/i-sugar-cal acoustic/i-sugar-hob-pi-0
