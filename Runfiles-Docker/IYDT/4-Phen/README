Joint analysis with 4 phenomenologies:
  seismic, acoustic, optical, crater

Sub-analysis Directories:

I-EIV - optimal models for each phenomenology with
        errors-in-variables yields for calibration data
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob - I-EIV with W/HOB inference for SUGAR
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi - I-EIV-SUGAR-hob except informative prior
                     distribution for W and HOB
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0 - two-stage rapid assessment of W/HOB
                    inference for "new event" SUGAR,
                    with errors-in-variables yields
                    for calibration data
I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi-0 - I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0 except informative prior
                       distribution for W and HOB

If a more informed starting value for MultiPEM
log-likelihood optimization is desired:
1) Create an "Opt" directory
2) Copy MLE results from each optimal single-
   phenomenology analysis into this "Opt"
   directory:
	cp ../Seismic/I/opt.RData Opt/opt_1.RData          seismic
	cp ../Acoustic/I/opt.RData Opt/opt_2.RData         acoustic
	cp ../Optical/I-EIV/opt.RData Opt/opt_3_eiv.RData  optical
	cp ../Crater/I-EIV/opt.RData Opt/opt_4_eiv.RData   crater

Additional starting values (optional):
3) After sub-analysis I-EIV completes, copy
   MLE results into this "Opt" directory
   prior to running I-EIV-SUGAR-* sub-analyses:
	cp I-EIV/opt.RData Opt/opt_I_eiv.RData

Running Sub-analyses:

1) Assume the "MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package" directory is placed
   in the user's home directory.

2) Create Dockerfile in each sub-analysis directory.

3) Build an image for each sub-analysis and run the image
   by starting a container. For example, to run the
   sub-analysis in the I-EIV directory, execute the following
   commands:

% cd I-EIV
% docker build -t 4-phen/i-eiv .
% docker run -it --rm -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT/4-Phen/I-EIV:\
  /I-EIV -d 4-phen/i-eiv

4) Once the sub-analysis completes, the image may be
   deleted by executing the command:

% docker image rm 4-phen/i-eiv

*** MULTI-STAGE RAPID ASSESSMENT ***

For rapid assessments in which the calibration inference
is intended for use in multiple new event inferences,
replace steps 3) and 4) above as follows:

3) Build an image for the calibration inference (stage 1)
   and run the image by starting a container. For example,
   to run the calibration inference in the I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0
   directory, execute the following commands:

% cd I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0
% docker build -f Dockerfile_cal -t 4-phen/i-eiv-sugar-cal .
% docker run -it --rm -v 4phen_eiv_cal:/4phen_eiv_cal -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT/4-Phen/I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0:\
  /I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0 -d 4-phen/i-eiv-sugar-cal

  The docker run command creates the volume 4phen_eiv_cal,
  which is used to persist the .RData file resulting from
  the stage 1 calibration inference so that it can be
  used in other analyses (obviating the need to run the
  same calibration inference multiple times).

  Upon completion of the stage 1 run, build an image for the
  new event inference (stage 2) and run the image by starting
  a container. For example, to run the new event inference in
  the I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi-0 directory, execute the following commands:

% cd I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi-0
% docker build -f Dockerfile_0 -t 4-phen/i-eiv-sugar-hob-pi-0 .
% docker run -it --rm -v 4phen_eiv_cal:/4phen_eiv_cal:ro -v \
  ~/MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package/Runfiles-Docker/IYDT/4-Phen/I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi-0:\
  /I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-pi-0 -d 4-phen/i-eiv-sugar-hob-pi-0

  Note that this docker run command binds to the 4phen_eiv_cal
  volume, in order to access the .RData file from the stage
  1 calibration inference as desired.

4) Once all analyses are complete, the volume and images
   may be deleted by executing the commands:

% docker volume rm 4phen_eiv_cal
% docker image rm 4-phen/i-eiv-sugar-cal 4-phen/i-eiv-sugar-hob-pi-0

If a more informed starting value for MultiPEM log-likelihood
optimization is desired:
1) Create an "Opt" directory
2) Copy MLE results from each optimal single-phenomenology
   analysis into this "Opt" directory:
	cp ../Seismic/I-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_1_0.RData
								seismic
	cp ../Acoustic/I-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_2_0.RData
								acoustic
	cp ../Optical/I-EIV-SUGAR-hob-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_3_eiv_0.RData
								optical
	cp ../Crater/I-EIV-SUGAR-0/opt.RData Opt/opt_4_eiv_0.RData
								crater
