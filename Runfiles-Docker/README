This directory will contain subdirectories for each application.
Each analysis for a given application will be designated by
individual subdirectories within the associated application
directory. Each analysis directory will contain a "runMPEM.r"
file that provides the R code that is to be run for that analysis.

The Code/ directory contains functions utilized across
applications, such as the log-likelihood, log-prior, and log-
posterior distributions and their associated gradients.

Analyses can be run by executing the following steps, assuming the
docker software has been installed on the user's machine:

1) In the MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package directory (one level up), create
the mpem/global image using docker:

% docker build -f Runfiles-Docker/Dockerfile -t mpem/global . 

2) In the MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package directory, create an image
mpem/<application> specific to the application. For example,
for <application> = iydt, execute the commands:

% docker build -f Runfiles-Docker/IYDT/Dockerfile -t mpem/iydt .

The Dockerfile will need to be edited to supply application-
specific code.

3) In the analysis directory, create an image
<application>/<analysis>. For example, for <application> =
iydt and <analysis> = seismic, execute the commands:

% cd IYDT/Seismic
% docker build -t iydt/seismic .

The Dockerfile will need to be edited to supply analysis-
specific code.

4) Run each sub-analysis from the appropriate directory. For
example, for <application> = iydt, <analysis> = seismic, and
<sub-analysis> = I, execute the commands:

% cd IYDT/Seismic/I
% docker build -t seismic/i .
% docker run -it --rm -v <full path to sub-analysis directory>:\
  <container directory for sub-analysis> -d seismic/i
