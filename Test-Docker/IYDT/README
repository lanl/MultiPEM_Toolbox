The verification tests for each phenomenology can be run by
executing the following steps, assuming the docker software
has been installed on the user's machine:

1) Build the mpem/iydt image (see the README file in the
   MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package/Runfiles-Docker directory).

2) In the MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package directory, build the
   iydt/test image using docker:

% docker build -f Test-Docker/IYDT/Dockerfile -t iydt/test .

3) Run the tests for each phenomenology. For example, for
   <analysis> = seismic, execute the commands:

% cd Seismic
% docker build -t test/seismic .
% docker run -it --rm -v <full path to analysis directory>:\
  /Test/Seismic -d test/seismic
