The file "tests.r" will generate output from two global
verifiction tests:
1) "Covariance": Verify Jacobian of transformation used for
   general observational error covariance structure
2) "FME_test": Verify performance of adaptive Markov chain
   Monte Carlo algorithm in R package FME by comparing
   posterior samples to analytical solutions

The global verification tests can be run by executing the
following steps, assuming the docker software has been installed
on the user's machine:

1) Build the mpem/global image (see the README file in the
   MultiPEM_Toolbox_Package/Runfiles-Docker directory).

2) Build the global/test image in this directory

% docker build -t global/test .

3) Run the global tests.

% docker run -it --rm -v <full path to this directory>:\
  /Test -d global/test
